#Code
A console application for my C++ skill sharpening and part of a bigger idea for a TI-1337.
This is just something really basic to help me better understand developement. Don't expect it to be of any real use; it's just for fun.
The interface is command-like which is 1337 already haha. My idea is to make an actual physical calculator which could do some more intensive stuff and cool hacks!
I consider this to be more of a simulator than a windows conosole application.
Anyway the slot-system is kind of like storage that you may or may not choose to save.
In the myconsole.exe you can create/edit/delete files, add their content to a temporary save slot system and do basic math...for now.
The icon for windows is also kinda neat :)
I'll probably add folder navigation and definetly more math/physics/programmable stuff.
My future goal is to use this on a device like an arduino or something really, really basic and barebone and long-lasting, and equip it with a small display, a keypad, a battery and an external storage.
The hardware part is still a concept.
